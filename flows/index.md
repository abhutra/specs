- [Ethereum Transaction Request Flow](tx.md)
- [Private Chain Provisioning Flow](privatechain.md)

## Errors

Wherever possible errors are based on [OAuth 2.0 RFC 6749 Authorization Errors](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.2.1)

An `error` parameter is returned as the response to the Client App, containing one of following:

Error         | Description
------------- | -----------
access_denied | User denies the request
